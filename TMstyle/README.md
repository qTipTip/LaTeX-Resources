### TMStyle

After browsing an online gallery of beautifully typeset LaTeX-documents, I
found a document prepared by Yves Zumbach
(https://github.com/thib1235/LaTeX/tree/master/examples/TM) His documents
featured very sleek tables and especially code listings, and in this repository
I tried to create a LaTeX-package where you can import the listings-style he
employs.

This is a work in progress, and is mostly for my own interest in learning how
LaTeX packages works.
